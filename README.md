Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project, I was tasked with creating a program that would help highschoolers understand fidcal responsibility. For the initial interactive program I was focused on intrest and demonstrating how it can compund. 
What did you do particularly well?
In my personal opinion, my code is extremely clear. I utilized functions and other OOP tactics in order to have code that was extremely legible. This is not only important as it made working on the code easier for myself but also lends itself to a level of transferbility. If any one else were ever to have need to manipulate my code I am certain they would be able to understand where and why code is located where it is.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
All code has room for enhancement. In my own code I was light on user validation. Including more validation lines would have created a more secure program.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
In this project, the most complex aspect was figuring out how to reduce the amount of code I was writing in main. By utilizing a class I was able to reduce my main function to primarily holding function calls and the over arching system loop. Watching videos of others approaching similiar problems is what initially gave me the idea to attempt using classes. There is a wealth of knowledge on the internet and watching peers work step by step through programs is an invaluable tool for learning.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The fundamental practices of OOP programing will be  highly transferable. Not just in other projects but in other roles completely as multiple languages use OOP.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I did my best to create a program that was highly modual by applying the best OOP practices. By creating individual functions to handle different cases and needs, the code covers all needed cases while also being ready to be added to or changed as coding needs change. Tweaks can be made to the code without disrupting everything.
